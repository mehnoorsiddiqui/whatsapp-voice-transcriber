# Create Chat Completion Request

## Structure

`CreateChatCompletionRequest`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `string` | Required | ID of the model to use. Currently, only `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` are supported. |
| `messages` | [`ChatCompletionRequestMessage[]`](../../doc/models/chat-completion-request-message.md) | Required | The messages to generate chat completions for, in the [chat format](/docs/guides/chat/introduction).<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Items*: `1` |
| `temperature` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.<br>**Default**: `1`<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 2` |
| `topP` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.<br>**Default**: `1`<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `n` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.<br>**Default**: `1`<br>**Constraints**: `>= 1`, `<= 128` |
| `stream` | `boolean \| undefined` | Optional | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.<br>**Default**: `false` |
| `stop` | `unknown \| undefined` | Optional | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. |
| `maxTokens` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). |
| `presencePenalty` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.<br><br>[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)<br>**Default**: `0`<br>**Constraints**: `>= -2`, `<= 2` |
| `frequencyPenalty` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.<br><br>[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)<br>**Default**: `0`<br>**Constraints**: `>= -2`, `<= 2` |
| `logitBias` | `unknown \| undefined` | Optional | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.<br><br>Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. |
| `user` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids). |
